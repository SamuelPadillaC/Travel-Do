# Travel-Do
This is probably one of the coolest and stupidest things I've ever coded.

This is literally a 3k line HTML/JS code to replicate the visuals of an applicaiton I was designing.
Everything is HTML, CSS, and JS. Even the cell phone shape.

This is pure vanilla JavaScript, the logic behind it was fairly challenging. For ridiculous and useless that this project might be, it genuinely made me very good in the JavaScript overall, and tested my notions of UX for the first time.
